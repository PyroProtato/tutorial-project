## Description
I am a relatively experienced pygame coder (see my other repos) however I haven't really yet expanded outside of my comfort zone of python and pygame. This is the first step in that journey! I created this godot game with the help of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&list=WL&index=3 in order to learn how to use the engine! I also added a ton of my own features and a unique map to make it my own!

## Personal Touches
 - Added the ability for the player to roll
 - Added new sounds
 - Added a sign feature that allows you to interact with signs and read them
 - Added custom moving platforms
 - Added UI elements (including a coin counter)

## Note
Be sure to check up in a few weeks! Hopefully by then I will have made a much better and more complicated godot game for Hack Club's Summer of Making Game Jam!
